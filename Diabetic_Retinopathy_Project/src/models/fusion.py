# Multi-Modal Fusion Architectures for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification
# ============================================================================
"""
This module implements sophisticated fusion architectures for combining information
from multiple medical imaging modalities in diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification.

The fusion approaches combine three complementary imaging modalities:
1. Fundus images - 2D color retinal photographs (structural information)
2. OCT volumes - 3D cross-sectional scans (layer thickness, morphology)
3. FLIO data - 4-channel fluorescence lifetime imaging (metabolic information)

Key fusion strategies implemented:
- Cross-attention fusion: Allows modalities to attend to each other
- Late fusion: Combines final features from each modality
- Intermediate fusion: Uses transformer to process modality features together

The architecture leverages foundation models (RETFound for fundus, OCTCube for OCT)
and custom encoders for FLIO data, providing state-of-the-art performance
through intelligent multi-modal integration.

    - Fundus images can attend to OCT layer thickness at corresponding locations
    - FLIO metabolic signals can attend to structural abnormalities in fundus
    - OCT morphology can attend to fluorescence patterns in FLIO
